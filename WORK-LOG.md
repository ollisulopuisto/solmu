## 2026-11-11: local flat groups

Branch feat/local-flat-groups, stacked on keymap #281. Implemented one-level
local membership, additive drag with Undo, assignment Apply/Cancel, original-chat
aliases and deduplicated unread totals. Group deletion cannot issue a backend
command. Read README and CONTRIBUTING; no AGENTS/BOARD/CODEX/roadmap/todo/bugs file
exists at the checkout root. See docs/flat-groups.md for behavior and limits.

Passed: membership tests in a standalone crate using the unchanged model source,
cargo check --locked --lib, cargo clippy --locked --lib -- -D warnings, formatting.
Native check used local current PipeWire headers because host headers are old;
no repository dependency or lockfile change. Full tests, Mac runtime and pixels
remain unverified. No merge or release build. Shared-keymap const compile repair
reported to its owner and repeated in this stack.

## 2026-11-11 - Beeper view-once composer visibility

Approved scope: hide the misleading photo View once toggle on Beeper chats. No send/upload changes and no merge order.

- Composer visibility now checks Beeper origin/account identity before showing the existing photo-only control, including restored selected drafts.
- No draft state is cleared or downgraded. The existing backend refusal is unchanged.
- Red-green: compiled the unchanged production visibility leaf as a standalone Rust test module. The Beeper test failed with the old predicate and both tests passed after the guard. This does not claim full native test-suite execution.
- Native demo build passed on Linux. Full native test compilation exceeds this environment's 2 GB memory; final CI and macOS/live-network interaction remain unverified.
